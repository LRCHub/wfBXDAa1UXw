[00:09.95] Come in to me, show us the way
[00:15.28] I'm caught between the wind and parts of the unknown
[00:21.80] A door between two worlds
[00:25.86] A sight to see
[00:32.86] 
[00:28.34] It feels like everything is moving
[00:35.95] Around me
[00:40.54] It feels like it is moving
[00:46.45] In time
[00:49.95] 
[01:34.98] Glider caught the breeze
[01:45.45] Feels like flying
[01:55.92] Every particle in sync
[02:06.47] Come on and guide me
[02:16.47] 
[02:17.03] Glider
[02:27.42] Glider
