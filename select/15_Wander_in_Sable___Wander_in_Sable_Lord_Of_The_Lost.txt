Cross backwoods of pain
And hillsides of fear in frightening clouds
Through oceans of harm
And we won't retrieve till salvation is ours

A wall of black
Come fall into line
Tonight, tonight

Wander in sable
Rethink and restart
Together we'll conquer this war in our hearts
So join us and see
You won't come to grief
Walking this long rocky road
Called road of relief

We travel the land, pass funk holes and forts
And mighty towers
Let hate merge to hope
No, we won't retain till the future is ours

A wall of black
Be part of the sway
Today, today

Wander in sable
Rethink and restart
Together we'll conquer this war in our hearts
So join us and see
You won't come to grief
Walking this long rocky road
Called road of relief

Wander in sable
Rethink and restart
Together we'll conquer this war in our hearts
So join us and see
You won't come to grief
Walking this long rocky road

Wander in sable
Rethink and restart
Together we'll conquer this war in our hearts
So join us and see
You won't come to grief
Walking this long rocky road
Called road of relief
