You lose your mind, you crash
A nervous breakdown
You feel an urge inside, you cru
sh
There's no escape now
You try to change your life, you
jump
Another letdown
But then you hear a voice inside
You gotta open up your vision
See the life bestowed on you
Blinded by reality
Broken ideology
Heart in captivity
Hold on
Exceeding the borders within
Seize your capability
Endless possibility
Find your individuality
Take pride, let the chase begin
Don't tell me what direction you
think I should take
(I know I'm gonna find the way)
Don't tell me that this sable is
for my own sake
(Hear what I've got to say)
Don't tell me to believe the dec
isions you make
(I'm facing a new day)
So open up your blinded eyes
Stop living a lie and start livi
ng your life
My way or no way
Today you're falling away
My way or no way
Today I'm breaking away
You need a sign, you search
You're burning out
Your heart is run down
A system shut down
All you want is to face the fata
l error
You'll never backdown
'Cause it's now that you know th
e time is right
You gotta lead a revolution
Believe the only light in you
Look now, my sweetest fantasy is
blinding your reality
I'm breaking down the walls surr
ounding
your riduculously boring ideolog
y
First chance, you let it slip aw
ay
One chance, you don't want to th
row away
Fate is turning, returning to yo
u square one
Get set and the game begins
Don't tell me that I'm making an
other mistake
(I know I'm gonna find the way)
Don't tell me that I'll end in a
nother heartache
(Hear what I've got to say)
Don't tell me that today is alre
ady too late
(I'm facing a new day)
So open up your blinded eyes
Stop living a lie and start livi
ng your life
Not everything is always what it
seems
But there are things beyond what
you could see
It doesn't mean that all the cri
tical things are lost
It doesn't take defiance to be h
eard
You never needed the anger to mo
ve on
All you need is the will to hold
on
Last chance
Take it or leave it
Nothing begins if you don't see
it
This is how your life goes
Don't tell me what direction you
think I should take
(I know I'm gonna find the way)
Don't tell me that this sable is
for my own sake
(Hear what I've got to say)
Don't tell me to believe the dec
isions you make
(I'm facing a new day)
So open up your blinded eyes
Stop living a lie and start livi
ng your life
My way or no way
Today you're falling away
My way or no way
Today I'm breaking away
