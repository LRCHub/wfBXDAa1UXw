Everyone's looking up to me
Where I've always wanted to be
The crowd's chanting my name
As wind blows through my rainbow mane

Standing at the starting line
Winter sun shines in my eyes
Goggles on it's almost time
I'll show them how the rainbow flies

Competition's in my blood
I race against my own ambition
Try to beat me if you can
Too late to back down you should take-

My advice you don't mess with awesome
No surprise we both know the outcome
Stepping to me you gotta be dreaming
Left in the dust there's no hard feelings

Faster than light and twenty percent cooler
Life is a race I refuse to be a loser
Here's the answer I'll go faster

Rushing air chills me to the skin
Feathers cold in the icy wind
Hear them flap as they're closing in
Well tough luck Rainbow came to win

Tearing through the atmosphere
Just remember why you're here
No distractions keep it clear
It's more than just to hear them cheer

I'll become somepony awesome
A symbol a light in the dark
I'll show them all I'll get up when I fall
A hero I'll carry the spark

Competition's in my blood
I race against my own ambition
Try to beat me if you can
Too late to back down
Take-

My advice you don't mess with awesome
No surprise we both know the outcome
Stepping to me you gotta be dreaming
Left in the dust there's no hard feelings

Faster than light and twenty percent cooler
Life is a race I refuse to be a loser
Here's the answer
I'll go faster

My advice you don't mess with awesome
No surprise we both know the outcome
Stepping to me you gotta be dreaming
Left in the dust there's no hard feelings

Faster than light and twenty percent cooler
Life is a race I refuse to be a loser
Just one answer
I'll go faster
